Welcome to Dor's README file

Some short explanation regarding the initation of the program.

first of all run 'npm install' in order to create all the dependencies (didn't upload node_modules, I can upload it if you like).

Backend:
In order to run the backend, make sure that you have node installed on your computer,
at the project directory/backend 
run 'npm run start' in order to run the server that supports getRestaurantList route

Frontend:
In order to run the frontend,
at the project directory/src
'run npm serve'


both of them run on localhost:8080 (the second one that you'll run, will get port 8081).

Assignment status:
Unfortunately I didn't make it to the bonuses. got into some time consuming problems while integrating between frontend and backend.
but the basic functionality works as expected, except one thing that the frontend request to the backend get 'Network Error', 
although the backend sends the response as expected (tested it with fiddler), it is Axios config problem.
